Welcome to Wedded List!

A guest list manager for all the events for your wedding. Once a user sets up their account via email and password or through Facebook, the user will be able to create Lists and Contacts.

Once a database is added (via lists and contacts) the user can add contacts to lists. When viewing a list the user will also be able to see all contacts that are included in that list that are local (same state as the event).

This is a simple application to help organize guest lists and contacts all in one place.

To use Wedded List:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run 'bundle install'
3. Run 'rake db:migrate' to migrate the database.
4. Run 'rails s' to start the local server.
5. Open your browser to 'http://localhost:3000' to run the app.
